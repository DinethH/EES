<h6>Certificate in Geology Education</h6>

<strong>Program Objective</strong>
<p>
In keeping with the mission of The University of Texas at Arlington to provide lifelong learning opportunities, the Earth & Environmental Sciences Department has created a Graduate Certificate in Geology Education.  The purpose of this certificate is to provide teaching professionals with graduate instruction in Geology as a means of maintaining and promoting their professional development.  The certificate provides a post-baccalaureate educational opportunity to teachers that is narrower in scope, and shorter in duration, than its associated graduate degree program. 
 </p>
<strong>Admission Requirements</strong>
<p>
The terms of admission allow participants to take specific courses approved for the
certificate program.  They are not allowed to take courses outside of their program.
 <br /><br />
Any student that later seeks a graduate degree in the MA program may apply 9 of the
12 hours of course work toward that program if done within 6 years of completion of the certificate by petitioning the Graduate School through her/his prospective academic
department.

All participants in the program must meet the normal GPA requirements of the Graduate
School, College, and Department.  In particular, they must maintain an overall GPA of
3.0 in order to receive the Certificate.
