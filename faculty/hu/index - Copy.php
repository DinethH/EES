        <p>
        For nearly twenty years, Dr. Hu's educational training and work experience have focused on fluid flow and chemical transport in the intersection of the hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere, particularly on the nexus of energy, environment, and water resources. His current research interests include the application of various experimental and theoretical approaches to pore structure characterization and its implications in chemical transfer in various geologic media (e.g., enhanced gas production in nonconventional reservoirs; long-term contaminant release from contaminated sediments). His research has produced about 70 publications in peer-reviewed journals, with the h-index of 14.
