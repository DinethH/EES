        <p>
       For nearly twenty years, Dr. Hu's educational training and work experience have focused on fluid flow and chemical transport in porous and fractured media, in the intersection of the hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere with relevance to sustainable energy (shale gas and oil, nuclear, and geothermal), environment, and water resources management. His current research interests include the application of various experimental and theoretical approaches to pore structure characterization and its implications in chemical transfer in various geologic media (e.g., enhanced hydrocarbon production in unconventional reservoirs; long-term contaminant release from contaminated sediments and aquifers). <br><br>
His research has produced 80+ publications in peer-reviewed journals, with a current h-index of 15. Moreover, he has delivered 138, from a total of nearly 200, oral presentations to scientific conferences and technical meetings of diverse audiences (including professional peers, project reviewers, senior managers, industry, and representatives of government agencies). As a subject expert, he has been invited to perform a total of 136 manuscript reviews for 63 different journals on multidisciplinary topics, in addition to proposal reviews for NSF, DOE, U.S. Civilian Research & Development Program, Austrian Science Foundation, Louisiana Board of Regents, South Carolinaâ€™s Institutions of Higher Education, and the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Early in 2013 he has also participated in the panel review for NSF and EPA proposals.
