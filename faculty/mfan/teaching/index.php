<h2>GEOL 3442 Sedimentology and Stratigraphy (Spring of 2012-14)</h2>
<p>This undergraduate upper-division course addresses the classification, origin, and interpretation of sediments and sedimentary rocks, and the methods of studying stratified rock. </p>
<p class="blue-text">Students take one campus field trip and three outcrop field trips.</p>

<br>

<h2>GEOL 4350/5332 Stable Isotope Geochemistry (Fall of 2013)</h2>
<p>This course aims at introducing the principles governing the fractionation and distribution of stable H, C, N, and O isotopes in nature, and their applications to environmental, and geologic questions. </p>
<p class="blue-text">Students work on individualized semester-long research project, and gain lab analysis, writing, and poster presentation experiences.</p>

<br>

<h2>GEOL 5370 Sedimentary Systems (Fall of 2012-13)</h2>
<p>This seminar-style course focuses on understanding the processes transporting and archiving siliciclastic sediment, and approaches to study siliciclastic sedimentary rocks to reconstruct earth surface processes. Through the course, we will gain the necessary background to comprehend and critically evaluate papers presented in some major journals.</p>
<p class="blue-text">Students gain presentation skills and the abilities to lead discussion and critically evaluate papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Students also learn thesis proposal writing skill and work on a mock thesis proposal.</p>

<br>

<h2>GEOL 4346/5371 Basin Analysis (Fall of 2012)</h2>
<p>This course focuses on understanding the classification and characteristics of different types of sedimentary basin, the mechanisms forming different types of basin, and the influence of basin evolution on petroleum generation, migration, and accumulation.</p>
<p class="blue-text">Students work on individualized semester-long research project, gain writing and poster presentation experiences, and learn to use basin-modeling softwares, such as Matlab and Petromod.
    <br>

<h2>GEOL 4307/5369 Sequence Stratigraphy (Fall of 2011)</h2>
<p>This course aims at introducing the control of eustasy, climate, and tectonics on sequence stratigraphy, and the principles and approaches applied to conduct sequence stratigraphic analysis. </p>
<p class="blue-text">Students work on well log and seismic data to conduct sequence stratigraphic analysis.</p>
