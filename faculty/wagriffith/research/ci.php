<div><p>Large, reservoir-scale sandstone  dikes, 1-3 meters in thickness and hundreds of meters in length, intrude the  shale-dominated Cretaceous Mowry formation at regular ~1 km intervals at Sheep  Mountain Anticline. Source material for the dikes was a sandstone member of the  overlying Frontier formation, thus the dikes represent significant potential  fluid pathways through impermeable shales of the Mowry formation. The interior  structure of the sandstone dikes is dominated by two pervasive sets of  deformation bands (DB1 and DB2) representing significant (~10%) porosity loss.  DB1 and DB2 bands maintain consistently distinct orientations, and DB1 bands  are offset by shearing along DB2. A detailed study of the internal structure of  the dikes will provide a better understanding of the hydraulic behavior of the  dikes and the net potential effect of the dikes on fluid flow at the reservoir  scale. In addition, detailed study of the development and deformation of the  dikes will yield insights into the tectonic and stress history of Sheep Mountain  Anticline. These insights will complement existing datasets based on  fold-fracture relationships. Through coordinated research projects we will (1)  reconstruct the 3D geometry of the dikes and surrounding country rocks using  high precision Differential GPS and traditional geologic mapping techniques,  (2) investigate fractures in the surrounding country rocks and deformation  bands within the dikes, (3) study the petrophysical implications of the  deformation bands using microscopy and image analysis, and (4) conduct  geomechanical modeling of to gain insights into the mechanics of dike formation  and deformation.</p></div>
