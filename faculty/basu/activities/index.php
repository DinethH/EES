        	  <p>I have been teaching science courses on mineralogy, petrology, and  geochemistry to undergraduate and graduate students for three decades at the  University of Rochester. </p>
        	</li>
        	<li>
        	  <p>I have served as an executive committee member of Volcanology,  Geochemistry and Petrology, American Geophysical Union, 1998-2004.  </p>
        	</li>
        	<li>
        	  <p>My research has yielded significant insights into continental flood  basalt volcanism, their petrogenesis, and geochemical heterogeneities in the  Earth&rsquo;s mantle. Using Nd-Sr isotopes and trace element geochemical tracers, I  have documented Mid-Miocene ridge-trench collision in California. I have also  contributed to the understanding of arsenic release mechanisms in groundwater  of the Bengal basin and on submarine groundwater discharge using Sr-isotopes as  tracers with implications for the marine strontium isotopic budget. </p>

        	  <p>I am a Fellow of the Geological Society of America, and the  American Association for the Advancement of Science (elected 2004.</p>
