<h3 class="news">NSF Funding</h3>
<p> Funded by the Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change program and led by Harry Rowe, Arne Winguth, and Max Hu of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at UT-Arlington, the project will study how the climate system in eastern North America evolved during the last eight glacial-interglacial cycles, which cover the last 600,000 years of Earth&rsquo;s history. Rowe and Hu, both geochemists, are reconstructing climate change using chemical and isotopic records preserved in cave stalagmites recovered from the Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee and West Virginia. Winguth, a climate modeler, is using the climate reconstructions as a guide to develop and refine simulations of the climate system for key periods of rapid climate change. </p>
