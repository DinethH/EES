</form>
    <div <?php if(!isset($_POST['rules'])) echo 'style="display:none"'; ?>>
      <p><strong>General</strong><br>
        Graduate  School rules and regulations for MS and PhD programs can be found <em><a href="http://www.uta.edu/gradcatalog/2011/general/regulations/">here</a></em>.  The following represents the department&rsquo;s implementation of these rules.<br>
  <strong><em>The  MS in Geology </em></strong>requires 24 hours of coursework and a  thesis. Students must select a thesis committee, consisting of a faculty  supervisor and two other faculty members, during the first semester of  residence. Courses are selected by the student in consultation with the faculty  supervisor or the graduate advisor, and the courses must be approved by the  thesis committee during the first year in residence. In addition, students must  write and defend a thesis proposal during the first year of residence. The  thesis committee will also serve as an examining committee for the thesis  proposal and the MS comprehensive examination. Students who do not have the  undergraduate prerequisites for graduate study in Geology may be required to  take them as course deficiencies.<br>
  <strong><em>The  MS in Environmental and Earth Sciences </em></strong>has thesis,  non-thesis and professional options. The thesis option requires a thesis plus  32 hours of coursework. The non-thesis and professional options requires 38  hours of coursework. For all options, students take 15 semester credit hours of  core courses in environmental science, engineering, and policy, and sufficient  hours of elective courses to meet degree requirements. For the professional  option, students must take a course on economics, participate in mentoring, and  complete an internship and research project. Elective courses are selected by  the student in consultation with the faculty supervisor or the graduate advisor.   All MS students take a comprehensive  exam before graduation and an examining committee of at least 3 faculty members  should be selected in consultation with the graduate advisor or thesis  supervisor. Students in the non-thesis option take a comprehensive exam over  their course work, and students in the thesis option usually answer questions  about their thesis after a short presentation. Students who do not have the  undergraduate prerequisites for graduate study in Environmental and Earth  Sciences may be required to take them as course deficiencies. These courses  must be completed within one year of enrolling in the program, unless  permission to do otherwise is obtained Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee.  Deficiency courses may be taken at community colleges.<br>
  <strong><em>The  PhD degree in Environmental and Earth Sciences </em></strong>is  a research degree and requires a dissertation consisting of original research.  In general, a student will not be accepted into the PhD program unless a  faculty member has agreed to serve as mentor. During the first year of  residence, the student must select a research advisor (who may be the mentor) and  four additional members of the faculty to serve as the examining committee.  During the first year, the examining committee will administer a diagnostic  exam designed to discover student strengths and weaknesses. The exam will be  used to design and approve a course program for the student. After the course  work is completed and after a dissertation proposal has been submitted, the  examining committee will administer the comprehensive examination. Generally  the dissertation proposal will be presented orally at the comprehensive  examination and be part of the examination.</p>
      <p><strong>Residency.</strong><br>
        For  the MS degrees, no more than 9 hours of graduate course work from another institution  may be applied to an MS degree from UTA. In addition, at least 18 hours of  graduate course work must be completed at UTA. Transfer credit is given only  upon approval of the Graduate Studies Committee and the Graduate Dean. Only  courses appropriate to the UTA Masters program will be accepted.<br>
        For  the PhD degree, there are no specific residency requirements. The PhD  supervisor and examining committee determine the number of courses that can be  transferred. </p>
      <p><strong>Time Limits, Assistantships, and Office Space.</strong><br>
        The  master's degree must be completed within six years from the student&rsquo;s initial  registration in the Graduate School. The Graduate Dean may grant extensions to  this time limit after a positive recommendation by the Graduate Studies  Committee of the Department.<br>
        All requirements for  the doctoral degree must be completed within four years after the student  unconditionally passes the comprehensive examination. The  Graduate Dean may grant extensions to this time limit after a positive  recommendation by the Graduate Studies Committee of the Department. <br>
        All  graduate students receiving financial support through Graduate Assistantships  (GA&rsquo;s) must take at least 9-credit hours/semester. MS students normally receive  support for a maximum of four academic semesters (summer semesters excluded). PhD  students normally receive support for a maximum of six academic semesters  (summer semesters excluded).<br>
        Assistantships  are available only for students in good standing. Students on probation or on provisional  status are normally not eligible for a graduate assistantship. <br>
        GA&rsquo;s  have first priority for office space and then those involved in  thesis/dissertation research. But as a general rule MS students should not expect  to have access to office space beyond the third year of residency and PhD  students beyond the fourth year of residency. </p>
      <p><strong>Courses and grade requirements</strong><br>
        All  MS and PhD students take graduate courses (Numbers 5000 – 6999). With approval  of the student&rsquo;s committee, up to 25% of the course work may be senior-level  undergraduate courses (numbers 4000 - 4999). To remain in good standing, students  must maintain a B average, GPA of 3.0 or better each semester. For graduate  students, a D is considered a failing grade and the course cannot be used for  degree requirements.<br>
        For  Geology MS students, two semesters of Geology 5199, the speaker series, is  required. The two credit hours count toward the required 24 hours of course  work, but only 1 credit hour of research coursework may be applied to the 24  credit hour requirement. </p>
      <p><strong>Thesis.</strong><br>
        Students  in a MS thesis program must enroll for 3, 6, or 9 semester hours of thesis  (GEOL 5398, 5698, or 5998 or EVSE 5398, 5698, or 5998) during each term thesis  research is conducted, and must be enrolled for 6 hours of thesis during the  semester they successfully defend the thesis and pass the final oral exam.<br>
        Students  in the PhD program must enroll in Dissertation hours (EVSE 6399, 6699, or 6999)  while working on dissertation research, and must be enrolled in 6 hours of  dissertation during the semester they successfully defend the dissertation.</p>
      <p><strong>Final Examination</strong>.<br>
        For  the MS Thesis option, students present the results of their research to the  Examining Committee and respond to their questions after submitting the written  thesis to the committee. By majority vote, the committee may pass, fail, or  defer the student.<br>
        For  the non-thesis and professional options, the final exam is over coursework. The  examination may be oral, written or both at the discretion of the examining  committee. By majority vote, the committee may pass, fail, or defer the  student.<br>
        For  the PhD program, the final exam is an oral defense of the dissertation. By  majority vote, the committee may pass, fail, or defer the student.</p>

  <p>Registration  in graduate courses MUST be CONTINUOUS from the time of first registration  unless a leave of absence is granted. Otherwise the student will be dropped  from the Graduate   School and will have to  reapply to be reinstated.<br>
    A  full course load for graduate students is 12 semester hours. Students with  half-time teaching or research assistantships must take a <u>minimum of 9  credit hours</u>. Geology MS students must register for two semesters in  Geology 5199 (Technical Sessions), so their student assistant course load is normally  10 hours during those two semesters. <br>
    The graduate advisor and/or faculty  supervisor (when selected) will advise and approve student course work before  registration each semester. <br>
    Students entering the program on <u>probationary  status</u> must maintain a B average (3.0 GPA) over the first 12 hours of  course work. Probationary students who do not have a 3.0 GPA after the first 12  hours will be dismissed. Students not on probation who do not maintain a 3.0  GPA will be placed on probation and have one semester to raise their GPA to  3.0. <br>
    Students entering the program under <u>provisional  status</u> are required to supply the graduate School with complete and  satisfactory credentials before the end of their first semester.<br>
    If a student wishes to drop a course,  the faculty supervisor and the Graduate Advisor must approve.</p>

<div <?php if(!isset($_POST['thesis'])) echo 'style="display:none"'; ?>>
  <p>The  research proposal is an outline of a program of research designed to answer one  or more specific questions. The purpose of the proposal is to demonstrate to  the supervisor and members of the committee that the student has sufficient  knowledge and appreciation of the proposed problem and the basic prerequisites  to look for answers. In many instances however, it is the pattern of  discoveries and other research related events that serve to set the direction  of the research, thus the research proposal is not meant as a binding, rigid  template for research. Rather, the proposal should be looked upon as a general  statement of research design and objectives to be pursued and modified as  appropriate.<br>
    The  dissertation proposal is the basis for the doctoral comprehensive examination.  Members of the supervisory committee should be given their preference of a  printed or electronic copy of the proposal at least two weeks prior to the date  of the examination. The student should also prepare an oral presentation of the  proposal. After this presentation, committee members may ask whatever questions  necessary to judge the soundness of the proposal and the adequacy of a student&rsquo;s  preparation to conduct the dissertation research. The doctoral comprehensive  examination must be scheduled in advance in accordance with dates permitted by  the Graduate School,  and the schedule form must be filed with the Graduate School.  Students are strongly encouraged to schedule their comprehensive examination as  far in advance as possible, because faculty members&rsquo; schedules often become very  busy during certain time periods.<br>
    The  proposal must be double-spaced throughout, have ample margins for comments, and  have the following sections as a minimum:<br>
    1.  Cover page with proposal title and your name  and date.<br>
    2.  Abstract (usually less than 500 words).<br>
    3.  Introduction: statement of the problem(s) and  importance/significance.<br>
    4.   History of Previous Research on this Topic  (what others have done).  This provides  an important historical perspective to the research.<br>
    5.   Objectives and expected outcomes (hypotheses)  of the Proposed Research<br>
    6.  Research Design and Procedures<br>
    7.  References Cited in Text.</p><br />

  <p>Dual  degree programs allow a student to complete two MS degree programs in related  areas. By participating in a dual degree program, students may apply 6-18 total  semester credit hours jointly to meet the requirements of both degrees, thus  reducing the total number of hours which would be required to earn both degrees  separately. The number of hours which may be jointly applied ranges from six to  18, subject to the approval of Graduate Advisors from both programs. Degree  plans, thesis or professional report proposals and programs of work must be  approved by Graduate Advisors from both programs. The successful candidate will  be awarded both degrees rather than one joint degree.<br>
    To  participate in the dual degree program, students must make separate application  to each program and must submit a separate program of work for each degree.  Those interested in the dual degree program should consult the appropriate  Graduate Advisors for further information on course requirements. See also the  statement on Dual Degree Programs in the general information section of the  Graduate Catalog.<br>
    Arrangements  to offer a dual degree have already been made between Environmental and Earth  Sciences and the Program in City and Regional Planning (M.C.R.P. degree), School of Urban and Public Affairs.</p><br />
